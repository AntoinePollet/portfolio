     Freelance Full-Stack Web Developer.
     <br>
     <br>
     As an experienced full-stack web developer, I specialize in building modern web applications. With expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, I can take projects from initial design to final deployment.
     <br>
     <br>
     Currently, I serve as the Lead Front-End Developer at <a href="https://www.eugene.app/">Eugene</a>, where I architect complex user interfaces, integrate with back-end services, and mentor junior developers.\n\nIn my freelance work, I've helped clients across industries bring their ideas to life through custom web applications, from e-commerce platforms to data visualization tools.
